description: Avoid embedding example payloads inside data_structure files

# Overview

Do not add example data or sample payloads to *data_structure.json* files. These files must define only schema: sections, fields, validations, notes. All sample data belongs in separate JSON example files.

Field IDs and labels must be descriptive and semantic. Do not include box number references (e.g., `_caja_X` in IDs or `(caja X)` in labels). Use the `boxNumber` field to store form box references instead.
