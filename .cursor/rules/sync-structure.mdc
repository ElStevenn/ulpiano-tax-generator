# Overview

When the user requests changes to the structure (sections, fields, types, validations, ordering, nested objects), always update the corresponding *data_structure.json* to keep the schema in sync with code, mappings, and examples. Do not leave structural edits only in code or examples; the data structure must be updated accordingly.
